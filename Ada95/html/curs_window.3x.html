<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Calling <STRONG>newwin</STRONG> creates and returns a pointer to a new win-
       dow with the given number of lines and columns.  The upper
       left-hand  corner of the window is at line <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM>, column
       <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>.  If either <EM>nlines</EM> or <EM>ncols</EM> is zero, they  default
       to  <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG> <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM> and <STRONG>COLS</STRONG> <STRONG>-</STRONG> <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>.  A new full-screen
       window is created by calling <STRONG>newwin(0,0,0,0)</STRONG>.

       Calling <STRONG>delwin</STRONG> deletes the named window, freeing all  mem-
       ory  associated  with  it  (it does not actually erase the
       window's screen image).  Subwindows must be deleted before
       the main window can be deleted.

       Calling <STRONG>mvwin</STRONG> moves the window so that the upper left-hand
       corner is at position (<EM>x</EM>, <EM>y</EM>).  If the move would cause the
       window to be off the screen, it is an error and the window
       is not moved.  Moving subwindows is allowed, but should be
       avoided.

       Calling <STRONG>subwin</STRONG> creates and returns a pointer to a new win-
       dow with the given number of lines, <EM>nlines</EM>,  and  columns,
       <EM>ncols</EM>.   The  window  is at position (<EM>begin</EM>_<EM>y</EM>, <EM>begin</EM>_<EM>x</EM>) on
       the screen.  (This position is relative to the screen, and
       not to the window <EM>orig</EM>.)  The window is made in the middle
       of the window <EM>orig</EM>, so that changes  made  to  one  window
       will  affect  both  windows.   The subwindow shares memory
       with the window <EM>orig</EM>.  When using this routine, it is nec-
       essary  to call <STRONG>touchwin</STRONG> or <STRONG>touchline</STRONG> on <EM>orig</EM> before call-
       ing <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> on the subwindow.

       dow <EM>orig</EM> rather than the screen.  There is  no  difference
       between the subwindows and the derived windows.

       Calling  <STRONG>mvderwin</STRONG>  moves  a  derived window (or subwindow)
       inside its parent window.  The screen-relative  parameters
       of  the  window  are not changed.  This routine is used to
       display different parts of the parent window at  the  same
       physical position on the screen.

       Calling  <STRONG>dupwin</STRONG>  creates  an exact duplicate of the window
       <EM>win</EM>.

       Calling <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> touches all locations in ancestors of  <EM>win</EM>
       that  are changed in <EM>win</EM>.  If <STRONG>syncok</STRONG> is called with second
       argument <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> then <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> is called  automatically  when-
       ever there is a change in the window.

       The  <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG>  routine  touches each location in <EM>win</EM> that
       has been touched in any of  its  ancestor  windows.   This
       routine  is  called by <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>, so it should almost never
       be necessary to call it manually.

       The routine <STRONG>wcursyncup</STRONG> updates the current cursor position
       of  all the ancestors of the window to reflect the current
       cursor position of the window.

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines that return an integer  return  the  integer  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value
       other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       <STRONG>delwin</STRONG> returns the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure  and  <STRONG>OK</STRONG>  upon
       successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If  many small changes are made to the window, the <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG>
       option could degrade performance.

       Note that <STRONG>syncok</STRONG> may be a macro.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The subwindow functions (<EM>subwin</EM>, <EM>derwin</EM>,  <EM>mvderwin</EM>,  <STRONG>wsyn-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>cup</STRONG>,  <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG>,  <STRONG>wcursyncup</STRONG>,  <STRONG>syncok</STRONG>)  are  flaky, incom-
       pletely implemented, and not well tested.

       The System V curses documentation is  very  unclear  about
       what <STRONG>wsyncup</STRONG> and <STRONG>wsyncdown</STRONG> actually do.  It seems to imply
       that they are only supposed to touch exactly  those  lines
       that are affected by ancestor changes.  The language here,
       and the behavior of the  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  implementation,  is  pat-

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue  4  describes  these  func-
       tions.
