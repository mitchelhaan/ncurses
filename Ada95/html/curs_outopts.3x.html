<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These routines set options that change the style of output
       within  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>.   All  options are initially <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>, unless
       otherwise stated.  It  is  not  necessary  to  turn  these
       options off before calling <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>.

       If  <STRONG>clearok</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> as argument, the next call
       to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG> with this window will clear  the  screen  com-
       pletely  and  redraw the entire screen from scratch.  This
       is useful when the contents of the screen  are  uncertain,
       or  in  some  cases for a more pleasing visual effect.  If
       the <EM>win</EM> argument to <STRONG>clearok</STRONG> is the global variable <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>,
       the  next  call  to  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>  with  any window causes the
       screen to be cleared and repainted from scratch.

       If <STRONG>idlok</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> as  second  argument,  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>
       considers using the hardware insert/delete line feature of
       terminals so equipped.  Calling <STRONG>idlok</STRONG> with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> as second
       argument  disables  use  of  line  insertion and deletion.
       This option should be  enabled  only  if  the  application
       needs  insert/delete  line, for example, for a screen edi-
       tor.  It is disabled by default because insert/delete line
       tends  to  be  visually annoying when used in applications
       where it isn't really needed.  If insert/delete line  can-
       not  be  used,  <STRONG>curses</STRONG> redraws the changed portions of all
       lines.

       If <STRONG>idcok</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> as second  argument,  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>
       no longer considers using the hardware insert/delete char-
       acter feature of terminals so equipped.  Use of  character
       insert/delete  is  enabled by default.  Calling <STRONG>idcok</STRONG> with
       <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> as second argument re-enables use of character inser-
       tion and deletion.

       If  <STRONG>immedok</STRONG> is called with <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> <STRONG>as</STRONG> <STRONG>argument</STRONG>, any change in
       <STRONG>fresh</STRONG>.  However, it may degrade performance  considerably,
       due  to  repeated  calls  to  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>.  It is disabled by
       default.

       Normally, the hardware cursor is left at the  location  of
       the  window  cursor  being  refreshed.  The <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG> option
       allows the cursor to be left wherever the  update  happens
       to leave it.  It is useful for applications where the cur-
       sor is not used, since it  reduces  the  need  for  cursor
       motions.   If  possible, the cursor is made invisible when
       this option is enabled.

       The <STRONG>setscrreg</STRONG> and <STRONG>wsetscrreg</STRONG> routines allow  the  applica-
       tion  programmer  to  set a software scrolling region in a
       window.  <EM>top</EM> and <EM>bot</EM> are the line numbers of the  top  and
       bottom margin of the scrolling region.  (Line 0 is the top
       line of the window.)  If  this  option  and  <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG>  are
       enabled,  an  attempt  to  move off the bottom margin line
       causes all lines in the scrolling  region  to  scroll  one
       line in the direction of the first line.  Only the text of
       the window is scrolled.  (Note that this has nothing to do
       with  the use of a physical scrolling region capability in
       the terminal, like that in the VT100.  If <STRONG>idlok</STRONG> is enabled
       and   the  terminal  has  either  a  scrolling  region  or
       insert/delete line capability, they will probably be  used
       by the output routines.)

       The  <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG> option controls what happens when the cursor
       of a window is  moved  off  the  edge  of  the  window  or
       scrolling  region,  either as a result of a newline action
       on the bottom line, or typing the last  character  of  the
       last line.  If disabled, (<EM>bf</EM> is <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>), the cursor is left
       on the bottom line.  If enabled, (<EM>bf</EM> is <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>), the  window
       is  scrolled  up  one  line (Note that in order to get the
       physical scrolling effect on the terminal, it is also nec-
       essary to call <STRONG>idlok</STRONG>).

       The  <STRONG>nl</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>nonl</STRONG> routines control whether the underlying
       display device translates the return key into  newline  on
       input,  and  whether it translates newline into return and
       line-feed on output (in either case,  the  call  <STRONG>addch('0)</STRONG>
       does the equivalent of return and line feed on the virtual
       screen).  Initially, these translations do occur.  If  you
       disable  them using <STRONG>nonl</STRONG>, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> will be able to make bet-
       ter use of the line-feed capability, resulting  in  faster
       cursor  motion.   Also, <STRONG>curses</STRONG> will then be able to detect
       the return key.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       The functions <STRONG>setscrreg</STRONG> and <STRONG>wsetscrreg</STRONG> return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon suc-
       cess  and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure. All other routines that return
       an integer always return <STRONG>OK</STRONG>.
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses  standard,
       Issue 4.

       The  XSI  Curses  standard is ambiguous on the question of
       whether <STRONG>raw</STRONG>() should disable the  CRLF  translations  con-
       trolled by <STRONG>nl</STRONG>() and <STRONG>nonl</STRONG>().  BSD curses did turn off these
       translations; AT&amp;T curses (at least as late as  SVr1)  did
       not.   We choose to do so, on the theory that a programmer
       requesting raw input wants a clean (ideally  8-bit  clean)
       connection that the operating system does not mess with.

       Some  historic  curses  implementations had, as an undocu-
       mented feature,  the  ability  to  do  the  equivalent  of
       <STRONG>clearok(...,</STRONG>  <STRONG>1)</STRONG>  by saying <STRONG>touchwin(stdscr)</STRONG> or <STRONG>clear(std-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>scr)</STRONG>.  This will not work under ncurses.

       Earlier System V  curses  implementations  specified  that
       with  <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG> enabled, any window modification triggering
       a scroll also forced a physical refresh.  XSI Curses  does
       not  require this, and <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> avoids doing it in order to
       perform better vertical-motion  optimization  at  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>
       time.

       The  XSI  Curses standard does not mention that the cursor
       should be made invisible  as  a  side-effect  of  <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG>.
       SVr4 curses does this.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that <STRONG>clearok</STRONG>, <STRONG>leaveok</STRONG>, <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG>, <STRONG>idcok</STRONG>, <STRONG>nl</STRONG>, <STRONG>nonl</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>setscrreg</STRONG> may be macros.

       The <STRONG>immedok</STRONG> routine is useful for windows that are used as
       terminal emulators.
