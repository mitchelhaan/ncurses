</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  is normally the first <STRONG>curses</STRONG> routine to call when
       initializing a program.  A few special routines  sometimes
       need  to  be called before it; these are <STRONG>slk_init</STRONG>, <STRONG>filter</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>ripoffline</STRONG>, <STRONG>use_env</STRONG>.  For multiple-terminal  applications,
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> may be called before <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.

       The initscr code determines the terminal type and initial-
       izes all <STRONG>curses</STRONG> data structures.  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> also causes  the
       first  call  to  <STRONG>refresh</STRONG>  to  clear the screen.  If errors
       occur, <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> writes  an  appropriate  error  message  to
       standard error and exits; otherwise, a pointer is returned
       to <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       A program that outputs to more than  one  terminal  should
       use  the  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  routine  for  each  terminal instead of
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.  A program that needs to inspect capabilities, so
       it can continue to run in a line-oriented mode if the ter-
       minal cannot support a screen-oriented program, would also
       use  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.   The  routine <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> should be called once
       for each terminal.  It returns a variable of type <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> <STRONG>*</STRONG>
       which  should  be  saved  as a reference to that terminal.
       The arguments are the <EM>type</EM> of the terminal to be  used  in
       place of <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG>, a file pointer for output to the terminal,
       and another file pointer for input from the  terminal  (if
       <EM>type</EM>  is <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>, <STRONG>$TERM</STRONG> will be used).  The program must also
       call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> for each terminal being  used  before  exiting
       from  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>.  If <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called more than once for the
       same terminal, the first terminal referred to must be  the
       last one for which <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> is called.

       A  program  should  always  call  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> before exiting or
       escaping  from  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  mode  temporarily.   This  routine
       restores  tty  modes,  moves the cursor to the lower left-
       hand corner of the screen and resets the terminal into the
       proper non-visual mode.  Calling <STRONG>refresh</STRONG> or <STRONG>doupdate</STRONG> after
       a temporary escape causes the  program  to  resume  visual
       mode.
       called without any subsequent calls to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>, and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG>
       otherwise.

       The  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG>  routine is used to switch between different
       terminals.  The screen reference <STRONG>new</STRONG> becomes the new  cur-
       rent  terminal.   The previous terminal is returned by the
       routine.  This  is  the  only  routine  which  manipulates
       <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG>  pointers;  all other routines affect only the cur-
       rent terminal.

       The <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> routine frees storage  associated  with  the
       <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG>  data  structure.   The  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> routine does not do
       this, so <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> should be called after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> if a par-
       ticular <STRONG>SCREEN</STRONG> is no longer needed.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  returns  the  integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> upon
       successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers always return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note that <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> and <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> may be macros.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       These  functions are described in the XSI Curses standard,
       Issue 4.  It specifies that portable applications must not
       call <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> more than once.
