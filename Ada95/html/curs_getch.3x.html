</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG> and <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG>, routines  read  a
       character  from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input
       is waiting, the value <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> is returned.  In delay mode, the
       program  waits until the system passes text through to the
       program.  Depending on the  setting  of  <STRONG>cbreak</STRONG>,  this  is
       after one character (cbreak mode), or after the first new-
       line (nocbreak mode).  In  half-delay  mode,  the  program
       waits  until a character is typed or the specified timeout
       has been reached.

       If <STRONG>noecho</STRONG> has been set, then the character  will  also  be
       echoed into the designated window according to the follow-
       ing rules: If the character is the current  erase  charac-
       ter,  left  arrow,  or  backspace, the cursor is moved one
       space to the left and that screen position is erased as if
       <STRONG>delch</STRONG>  had  been  called.   If  the character value is any
       other <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG> define, the user is alerted with a  <STRONG>beep</STRONG>  call.
       Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.

       If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modi-
       fied since the last call to  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>,  <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>  will  be
       called before another character is read.

       If  <STRONG>keypad</STRONG>  is  <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG>,  and  a function key is pressed, the
       token for that function key is returned instead of the raw
       characters.    Possible   function  keys  are  defined  in
       <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG> as macros with  values  outside  the  range  of
       8-bit  characters  whose  names  begin  with <STRONG>KEY_.</STRONG> Thus, a
       variable intended to hold the return value of  a  function
       key must be of short size or larger.

       When a character that could be the beginning of a function
       key is received (which,  on  modern  terminals,  means  an
       escape  character), <STRONG>curses</STRONG> sets a timer.  If the remainder
       of the sequence does not come  in  within  the  designated
       time,  the  character  is  passed  through; otherwise, the
       function key value is returned.   For  this  reason,  many
       terminals  experience  a  delay  between  the  time a user

       The <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG> routine places <EM>ch</EM> back onto the input queue to
       be returned by the next call to <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>.  Note  that  there
       is, in effect, just one input queue for all windows.


   <STRONG>Function</STRONG> <STRONG>Keys</STRONG>
       The  following function keys, defined in <STRONG>&lt;curses.h&gt;</STRONG>, might
       be returned by <STRONG>getch</STRONG> if <STRONG>keypad</STRONG>  has  been  enabled.   Note
       that  not  all  of  these are necessarily supported on any
       particular terminal.

       Keypad is arranged like this:

       center allbox tab(/) ; c c  c  .   <STRONG>A1</STRONG>/<STRONG>up</STRONG>/<STRONG>A3</STRONG>  <STRONG>left</STRONG>/<STRONG>B2</STRONG>/<STRONG>right</STRONG>
       <STRONG>C1</STRONG>/<STRONG>down</STRONG>/<STRONG>C3</STRONG>

       The <STRONG>has_key</STRONG> routine takes a key value from the above list,
       and returns TRUE or FALSE according as the current  termi-
       nal type recognizes a key with that value.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All  routines  return  the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and an
       integer value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> (<STRONG>OK</STRONG> in the case of ungetch())
       upon successful completion.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single charac-
       ter function is discouraged, as it will cause a  delay  of
       up to one second while the keypad code looks for a follow-
       ing function-key sequence.

       When using <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG>, or  <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG>,  nocbreak
       mode (<STRONG>nocbreak</STRONG>) and echo mode (<STRONG>echo</STRONG>) should not be used at
       the same time.  Depending on the state of the  tty  driver
       when  each  character  is  typed,  the program may produce
       undesirable results.

       Note that <STRONG>getch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetch</STRONG>, and <STRONG>mvwgetch</STRONG> may be macros.

       Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined
       by  the  extremely  function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&amp;T
       7300, aka 3B1, aka Safari 4.   Modern  personal  computers
       usually  have  only a small subset of these.  IBM PC-style
       consoles  typically  support  little  more  than   <STRONG>KEY_UP</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>KEY_DOWN</STRONG>,    <STRONG>KEY_LEFT</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_RIGHT</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_HOME</STRONG>,   <STRONG>KEY_END</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>KEY_NPAGE</STRONG>, <STRONG>KEY_PPAGE</STRONG>, and function keys 1 through 12.  The
       Ins key is usually mapped to <STRONG>KEY_IC</STRONG>.

<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       The  *get* functions are described in the XSI Curses stan-
       dard, Issue 4.  They  read  single-byte  characters  only.
       The  standard  specifies  that they return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> on failure,
       but specifies no error conditions.

       The echo behavior of these functions on input of  <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG>  or
       backspace  characters  was not specified in the SVr4 docu-

       The  behavior of <STRONG>getch</STRONG> and friends in the presence of han-
       dled signals is unspecified in the  SVr4  and  XSI  Curses
       documentation.   Under  historical curses implementations,
       it varied depending  on  whether  the  operating  system's
       implementation  of  handled  signal  receipt  interrupts a
       <STRONG><A HREF="read.2.html">read(2)</A></STRONG> call in progress or not, and also (in some  imple-
       mentations)  depending on whether an input timeout or non-
       blocking mode hsd been set.

       Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared
       for  either  of  two  cases:  (a)  signal receipt does not
       interrupt <STRONG>getch</STRONG>; (b) signal receipt interrupts  <STRONG>getch</STRONG>  and
       causes  it  to  return ERR with <STRONG>errno</STRONG> set to <STRONG>EINTR</STRONG>.  Under
       the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> implementation, handled signals  never  inter-
       rupt <STRONG>getch</STRONG>.

       The  <STRONG>has_key</STRONG>  function is unique to <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>.  We recommend
       that  any  code  using  it  be  conditionalized   on   the
       <STRONG>NCURSES_VERSION</STRONG> feature macro.
