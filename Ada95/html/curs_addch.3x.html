</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  <STRONG>addch</STRONG>,  <STRONG>waddch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvaddch</STRONG> and <STRONG>mvwaddch</STRONG> routines put the
       character <EM>ch</EM> into the given window at its  current  window
       position,  which  is then advanced.  They are analogous to
       <STRONG>putchar</STRONG> in <STRONG><A HREF="stdio.3.html">stdio(3)</A></STRONG>.  If the advance is at the right  mar-
       gin,  the  cursor  automatically wraps to the beginning of
       the next line.  At the bottom  of  the  current  scrolling
       region,  if  <STRONG>scrollok</STRONG>  is enabled, the scrolling region is
       scrolled up one line.

       If <EM>ch</EM> is a tab, newline, or backspace, the cursor is moved
       appropriately within the window.  Backspace moves the cur-
       sor one character left; at the left edge of  a  window  it
       does  nothing.   Newline  does  a <STRONG>clrtoeol</STRONG>, then moves the
       cursor to  the  window  left  margin  on  the  next  line,
       scrolling  the window if on the last line).  Tabs are con-
       sidered to be at every eighth column.

       If <EM>ch</EM> is any control character other than tab, newline, or
       backspace,  it  is  drawn  in  <STRONG>^</STRONG><EM>X</EM> notation.  Calling <STRONG>winch</STRONG>
       after adding a control character does not return the char-
       acter  itself, but instead returns the ^-representation of
       the control character.  (To emit control characters liter-
       ally, use <STRONG>echochar</STRONG>.)

       Video attributes can be combined with a character argument
       passed to <STRONG>addch</STRONG> or related functions by logical-ORing them
       into  the  character.   (Thus, text, including attributes,
       can be copied from one place to  another  using  <STRONG>inch</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>addch</STRONG>.).   See the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_attr.3x.html">curs_attr(3X)</A></STRONG> page for values of prede-
       fined video attribute constants that can be usefully OR'ed
       into characters.

       The  <STRONG>echochar</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>wechochar</STRONG> routines are equivalent to a
       call to <STRONG>addch</STRONG> followed by a call to <STRONG>refresh</STRONG>, or a call  to
       <STRONG>waddch</STRONG> followed by a call to <STRONG>wrefresh</STRONG>.  The knowledge that
       only a single character is being output is used  and,  for
       non-control  characters,  a  considerable performance gain

   <STRONG>Line</STRONG> <STRONG>Graphics</STRONG>
       The  following  variables  may be used to add line drawing
       characters to the screen with routines of the  <STRONG>addch</STRONG>  fam-
       ily.   The  default  character listed below is used if the
       <STRONG>acsc</STRONG>  capability  doesn't   define   a   terminal-specific
       replacement for it (but see the EXTENSIONS section below).
       The names are taken from VT100 nomenclature.

</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All routines return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on
       success  (the  SVr4 manuals specify only "an integer value
       other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion, unless other-
       wise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Note  that  <STRONG>addch</STRONG>,  <STRONG>mvaddch</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvwaddch</STRONG>, and <STRONG>echochar</STRONG> may be
       macros.


</PRE>
<H2>EXTENSIONS</H2><PRE>
       The following extended <STRONG>curses</STRONG> features are available  only
       on  PC-clone consoles and compatible terminals obeying the
       ANSI.SYS de-facto standard for terminal control sequences.
       They are not part of XSI curses.

       The attribute A_ALTCHARSET actually forces literal display
       of PC ROM characters  including  the  high-half  graphics.
       the card-suit characters, up and down-arrow, and most oth-
       ers in the range 0-32.  (In a terminfo entry designed  for
       use  with  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>,  the high-half characters are obtained
       using this attribute with an <STRONG>acsc</STRONG> string in which the sec-
       ond of each pair is a high-half character.)

       Giving  <STRONG>wechochar</STRONG>  an  argument with its high bit set will
       produce the corresponding high-half  ASCII  graphic  (SVr4
       curses also has this feature but does not document it).  A
       control-character argument, however,  will  not  typically
       produce  the corresponding graphic; characters such as CR,
       NL, FF and TAB are typically interpreted  by  the  console
       driver  itself,  and ESC will be interpreted as the leader
       of a control sequence.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTABILITY</H2><PRE>
       All these functions are described in the XSI Curses  stan-
       dard,  Issue  4.  The defaults specified for forms-drawing
       characters apply in the POSIX locale.

       The seven ACS symbols starting with <STRONG>ACS_S3</STRONG> were not  docu-
       mented  in  any publicly released System V.  However, many
       publicly available terminfos include <STRONG>acsc</STRONG> strings in which
       their key characters (pryz{|}) are embedded, and a second-
       hand list of their  character  descriptions  has  come  to
       light.   The ACS-prefixed names for them were invented for
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>.
