<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Panels  are  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3X)</A></STRONG>  windows with the added feature of
       depth.  Panel functions allow the use of  stacked  windows
       and  ensure  the  proper  portions  of each window and the
       curses <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> window are hidden or displayed  when  panels
       are  added,  moved,  modified or removed.  The set of cur-
       rently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>
       window  is  beneath all panels, and is not considered part
       of the stack.

       A window is associated with every panel.  The  panel  rou-
       tines  enable you to create, move, hides, and show panels,
       as well as position a panel at any desired location in the
       stack.

       Panel routines are a functional layer added to <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3X)</A></STRONG>,
       make only high-level curses calls, and work anywhere  ter-
       minfo curses does.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>new_panel(win)</STRONG>
              allocates   a   <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure, associates it with
              <STRONG>win</STRONG>, places the panel  on  the  top  of  the  stack
              (causes   it  to   be   displayed  above  any other
              panel) and returns a pointer to the new panel.

       <STRONG>void</STRONG> <STRONG>update_panels()</STRONG>
              refreshes the virtual screen to reflect  the  rela-
              tions between the panels in the stack, but does not
              update_panels() may be called more than once before
              a  call  to doupdate(), but doupdate() is the func-
              tion responsible for updating the physical  screen.

       <STRONG>del_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              removes the given panel from the  stack and deallo-
              cates the <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure (but not  its  associated
              window).

       <STRONG>hide_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              removes  the  given  panel from the panel stack and
              thus hides it from view. The <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> structure is not
              lost, merely removed from the stack.

       <STRONG>show_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              makes  a  hidden panel visible by placing it on top
              of the panels in the panel stack. See COMPATIBILITY
              below.

       <STRONG>top_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              puts  the  given visible panel on top of all panels
              in the stack.  See COMPATIBILITY below.

       <STRONG>bottom_panel(pan)</STRONG>
              puts panel at the bottom of all panels.

       <STRONG>move_panel(pan,starty,startx)</STRONG>
              moves the given panel window so that its upper-left
              corner  is  at  <STRONG>starty</STRONG>, <STRONG>startx</STRONG>.  It does not change
              the position of the panel in the stack.  Be sure to
              use  this  function,  not  <STRONG>mvwin()</STRONG>, to move a panel
              window.

       <STRONG>replace_panel(pan,window)</STRONG>
              replaces the current window of  panel  with  <STRONG>window</STRONG>
              (useful, for example if you want to resize a panel;
              if you're using <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>, you can call <STRONG>replace_panel</STRONG>
              on  the output of <STRONG><A HREF="wresize.3x.html">wresize(3X)</A></STRONG>).  It does not change
              the position of the panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>panel_above(pan)</STRONG>
              returns a pointer to the panel above pan.   If  the
              panel  argument is <STRONG>(PANEL</STRONG> <STRONG>*)0</STRONG>, it returns a pointer
              to the bottom panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>panel_below(pan)</STRONG>
              returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.   If
              the  panel  argument  is  <STRONG>(PANEL</STRONG>  <STRONG>*)0</STRONG>, it returns a
              pointer to the top panel in the stack.

       <STRONG>set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr)</STRONG>
              sets the panel's user pointer.
              returns the user pointer for a given panel.

       <STRONG>panel_window(pan)</STRONG>
              returns a pointer to the window of the given panel.


</PRE>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Each  routine  that  returns  a pointer returns <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> if an
       error occurs. Each  routine  that  returns  an  int  value
       returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG> if it executes successfully and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if not.


</PRE>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2><PRE>
       Reasonable  care  has been taken to  ensure  compatibility
       with  the  native  panel  facility  introduced  in  SVr3.2
       (inspection of the SVr4 manual pages suggests the program-
       ming interface is unchanged).  The <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG>  data  structures
       are  merely   similar. The  programmer is cautioned not to
       directly use <STRONG>PANEL</STRONG> fields.

       The functions <STRONG>show_panel()</STRONG> and <STRONG>top_panel()</STRONG>  are  identical
       in  this  implementation,  and work equally well with dis-
       played or hidden panels.  In the native System V implemen-
       tation, <STRONG>show_panel()</STRONG> is intended for making a hidden panel
       visible (at the top  of  the  stack)  and  <STRONG>top_panel()</STRONG>  is
       intended  for  making an already-visible panel move to the
       top of the stack. You are cautioned  to  use  the  correct
       function   to   ensure  compatibility  with  native  panel
       libraries.

<H2>NOTE</H2><PRE>
       In your library list, libpanel.a should  be  before  libn-
       curses.a;  that  is,  you want to say `-lpanel -lncurses',
       not the other way around (which  would  give  you  a  link
       error using GNU <STRONG><A HREF="ld.1.html">ld(1)</A></STRONG> and some other linkers).
