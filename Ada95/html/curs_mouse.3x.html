<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions provide an interface to mouse events  from
       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>.   Mouse  events  are represented by <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>
       pseudo-key values in the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> input stream.

       To make mouse events visible, use the <STRONG>mousemask</STRONG>  function.
       This  will  set  the  mouse  events  to  be  reported.  By
       default, no mouse events are reported.  The function  will
       return  a  mask  to  indicate which of the specified mouse
       events can be reported; on complete failure it returns  0.
       If  oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the indicated
       location with the previous value  of  the  given  window's
       mouse event mask.

       As  a  side  effect, setting a zero mousemask may turn off
       the mouse pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it  on.
       Whether this happens is device-dependent.

       Here are the mouse event type masks:

       l  l  _ _ l l.  <EM>Name</EM> <EM>Description</EM> BUTTON1_PRESSED     mouse
       button  1  down  BUTTON1_RELEASED    mouse  button  1   up
       BUTTON1_CLICKED     mouse       button      1      clicked
       BUTTON1_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  1  double  clicked
       BUTTON1_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  1  triple  clicked
       BUTTON2_PRESSED     mouse       button       2        down
       BUTTON2_RELEASED    mouse        button        2        up
       BUTTON2_CLICKED     mouse      button      2       clicked
       BUTTON2_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  2  double  clicked
       BUTTON2_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  2  triple  clicked
       BUTTON3_PRESSED     mouse        button       3       down
       BUTTON3_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  3  double  clicked
       BUTTON3_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  3  triple  clicked
       BUTTON4_PRESSED     mouse       button       4        down
       BUTTON4_RELEASED    mouse        button        4        up
       BUTTON4_CLICKED     mouse      button      4       clicked
       BUTTON4_DOUBLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  4  double  clicked
       BUTTON4_TRIPLE_CLICKED   mouse  button  4  triple  clicked
       BUTTON_SHIFT   shift  was  down during button state change
       BUTTON_CTRL    control was down during button state change
       BUTTON_ALT     alt  was  down  during  button state change
       ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS    report  all   button   state   changes
       REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION    report mouse movement

       Once  a  class of mouse events have been made visible in a
       window, calling the <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> function  on  that  window  may
       return  <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>  as  an indicator that a mouse event has
       been queued.  To read the event data and pop the event off
       the queue, call <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG>.  This function will return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> if
       a mouse event is actually visible in the given window, <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>
       otherwise.   When  <STRONG>getmouse</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>, the data deposited
       as y and x in the  event  structure  coordinates  will  be
       screen-relative  character-cell coordinates.  The returned
       state mask will have exactly one bit set to  indicate  the
       event type.

       The  <STRONG>ungetmouse</STRONG>  function  behaves analogously to <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>.
       It pushes a <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG> event  onto  the  input  queue,  and
       associates  with  that  event  the  given  state  data and
       screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

       The <STRONG>wenclose</STRONG>  function  tests  whether  a  given  pair  of
       screen-relative  character-cell coordinates is enclosed by
       a given window, returning TRUE if it is and  FALSE  other-
       wise.   It  is  useful  for determining what subset of the
       screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

       The <STRONG>mouseinterval</STRONG> function sets the maximum time (in thou-
       sands  of  a  second)  that  can  elapse between press and
       release events in order for them to  be  recognized  as  a
       click.  This function returns the previous interval value.
       The default is one fifth of a second.

       Note that mouse events will be ignored when  input  is  in
       cooked mode, and will cause an error beep when cooked mode
       is being simulated in a window by a function such as  <STRONG>get-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>str</STRONG> that expects a linefeed for input-loop termination.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       All  routines  return  the  integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure or <STRONG>OK</STRONG>
       upon successful completion.

       These calls were designed for  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>,  and  are  not
       found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous
       version of curses.

       The feature macro <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</STRONG> is provided so the
       preprocessor  can  be  used to test whether these features
       are present (its value is 1).   NOTE:  THIS  INTERFACE  IS
       EXPERIMENTAL  AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!  If
       the interface is changed, the value of  <STRONG>NCURSES_MOUSE_VER-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>SION</STRONG> will be incremented.

       The  order  of the <STRONG>MEVENT</STRONG> structure members is not guaran-
       teed.  Additional fields may be added to the structure  in
       the future.

       Under  <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG>,  these  calls  are  implemented  using
       either xterm's built-in mouse-tracking API  or  Alessandro
       Rubini's  gpm  server.   If  you are using something other
       than xterm there is no gpm daemon running on your machine,
       mouse  events  will not be visible to <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3X)</A></STRONG> (and the
       <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG> function will always return <STRONG>0</STRONG>).

       The z member in the event structure is not presently used.
       It  is  intended  for use with touch screens (which may be
       pressure-sensitive)   or   with   3D-mice/trackballs/power
       gloves.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Mouse  events under xterm will not in fact be ignored dur-
       ing cooked mode, if they have been enabled by  <STRONG>wmousemask</STRONG>.
       Instead,  the  xterm  mouse report sequence will appear in
       the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in
       a window with its keypad bit off.
