       <STRONG>form_win</STRONG>  - make and break form window and subwindow asso-
       ciations


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>#include</STRONG> <STRONG>&lt;form.h&gt;</STRONG>
       int set_form_win(FORM *form, WINDOW *win);
       WINDOW *form_win(const FORM *form);
       int set_form_sub(FORM *form, WINDOW *sub);
       WINDOW *form_sub(const FORM *form);
       int scale_form(const FORM *form, int *rows, int *columns);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Every  form has an associated pair of <STRONG>curses</STRONG> windows.  The
       form window displays any title and border associated  with
       the  window;  the form subwindow displays the items of the
       form that are currently available for selection.

       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is
       not necessary to set either window; by default, the driver
       code uses <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG> for both.

       In the <STRONG>set_</STRONG> functions, window argument of <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> is  treated
       as  though  it  were  <STRONG>stsdcr</STRONG>.   A form argument of <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> is
       treated as a request to change  the  system  default  form
       window or subwindow.

       The   function   <STRONG>scale_window</STRONG>  returns  the  minimum  size
       required for the subwindow of <EM>form</EM>.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.   Rou-
       tines  that  return an integer return one of the following
       error codes:

       <STRONG>E_OK</STRONG> The routine succeeded.

       <STRONG>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</STRONG>
            System error occurred (see <STRONG>errno</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</STRONG>
            Routine detected an incorrect or  out-of-range  argu-
            ment.

       <STRONG>E_POSTED</STRONG>
            The form has already been posted.

       <STRONG>E_NOT_CONNECTED</STRONG>
            No items are connected to the form.

       were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
